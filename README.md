# heart-disease-prediction

- In this notebook I will attempt to use Python libraries to create a model that predicts if a patient has heart disease.
- The goal is to reach around 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not the patient has heart disease.
- There are 13 attributes
  - age: age in years
  - sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
  - cp: chest pain type 
    - Value 0: typical angina
    - Value 1: atypical angina
    - Value 2: non-anginal pain
    - Value 3: asymptomatic
  - trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
  - chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
  - fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
  - restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
    - Value 0: normal
    - Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
    - Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
  - thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
  - exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
  - oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
  - slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
    - Value 0: upsloping
    - Value 1: flat
    - Value 2: downsloping
  - condition: 0 = no disease, 1 = disease
